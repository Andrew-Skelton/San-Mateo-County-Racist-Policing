# San-Mateo-County-Racist-Policing
This project is a data analysis of racist policing practices in San Mateo County.

Hello! I have created this repository to publicly keep track of my senior thesis, a data analysis of racist policing practices in San Mateo County. The data used for this project was obtained from the California Department of Justice website, https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data, as well as through FOIA requests submitted to police departments in San Mateo County. As of right now, I am only analyzing the San Mateo Police Department and the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department, I hope to expand this project to analyze other departments in the future.
